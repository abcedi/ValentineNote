    <p>Hi Jojo!!! Happy Valentines Day My Love!</p>
    <p>I love you so so much you know. This is now our 2nd Valentines Day together and Im so thankful for you being by my side this whole time. Thank you for being you. Thank you for loving me. And thank you for making mfe feel like the most special boy there is. I cannot imagine an existance without you as you are now a big part of my world.</p>
    <p>I fucking hate the days without you and I hate being apart from you. Im sorry I come home mad sometimes, its just without your presence during my shifts or my school, I get soooo stressed and angry and annoyed at everything! Everytime were seperated, its like a part of me is completely missing. I come home and see you attention is somewhere else like a friend or Valorant, I get so upset and I guess jealous. I know its bad and I shouldnt be like this but Its just who I am right now. I hate seeing your attention onto someone else. I just want you ALLL for myself.</p>
    <p>Happy Valentines Day again. I Love You so so much Jo!</p>
